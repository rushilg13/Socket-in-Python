Socket in Python
<br>
TCP socket routines enable reliable IP communication using the transmission control protocol (TCP).
<br>
This section describes the implementation of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the Network Component. TCP runs on top of the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP is a connection-oriented and reliable, full duplex protocol supporting a pair of byte streams, one for each direction. A TCP connection must be established before exchanging data. TCP retransmits data that do not reach the final destination due to errors or data corruption. Data is delivered in the sequence of its transmission. Applications that do not require the reliability of a TCP connection may instead use the connectionless User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
